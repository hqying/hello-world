Learning to use Git and GitHub!
My first project.
Anyway, I notice the only two words geeks know are foo and bar, and the only sentence that geeks know is "Hello, world".
I don't know why but I'd just follow.
That's why the first name of my repo or project is hello-world.
Enjoy! (Okey, that might not mean you'd enjoy this project which sucks, but I'd have fun with it.
This is the first version but it only contains README.txt.
